# Make-10

Make-10 is a numbers game played with ordinary playing cards where you need to make 10. To make 10, you add up the numbers on your cards. Jacks are 1s, Queens are 2s, and Kings are 3s. 

In make-10 the numbers loop around after 10, so if I have a 4 I could add a 8 and it would become a 2. Then I could add an 8 and it would become a 10. 

Once you make 10 exactly, you pass the pile to a player of your choice. It does not go into their hand - they keep it in front of them. 

If you cannot make 10 with cards in your hand, you have to draw a card from the deck. 

The game ends when the deck runs out, and everybody counts how many cards they have in the pile in front of them (not in their hands). The player with the fewest cards wins.
